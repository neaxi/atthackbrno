# Getting started with our Raspberry Pi

Hello, in front of you is Raspberry Pi 3 loaded with a default Raspbian OS.  
In case you would want to flash this image onto your device, ~~you can find the .img file on local file share~~ ask one of the mentors to provide you with the image.

## Network / How to connect

### Wi-Fi

Raspberry is set to connect automatically to provided wifi network.  
IP address is assigned by our DHCP server.  
To find an IP for your Raspberry check the label on the board.  
It's going to be 10.10.1.[raspi number]. I.e.:  
RasPi01 = 10.10.1.1  
RasPi02 = 10.10.1.2  
and so on...  

### Ethernet

Interface is set to 192.168.1.10/24 so please set your laptop on the same subnet if you wish to connect via cable.  
The connection is available mainly for direct connection with your laptop.  

If you wish to test your application with ethernet connection, please change IP assignment to dhcp/dynamic before connecting to the switch. There are two options on how to do it:  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **opt GUI)** change the setting in the system Network manager  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **opt CLI)** comment out the static assignemnt in /etc/dhcpcd.conf  

Once connected you'll obtain IP equal to 10.10.1.100+[raspi number]  
RasPi01 = 10.10.1.101  
RasPi02 = 10.10.1.102  
etc...

## Access & Passwords

Available connections:

* SSH for CLI.
* SFTP/SCP for file transfer.
* VNC for remote GUI control.

Passwords are the same for all the boards.  
Please change them to your own as a first step to prevent access of the other teams to your device.
